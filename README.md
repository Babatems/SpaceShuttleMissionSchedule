NASA Space Shuttle TV Schedule Transfer to Outlook Calendar[^1]

This project was hosted on CodePlex which Microsoft closed and later decommissioned. Development on this
project ended with wheel stop of the final flight of the Space Shuttle.

## Project Description

The NASA Space Shuttle TV Schedule Transfer to Outlook Calendar is a user-friendly tool that enables you to seamlessly transfer NASA's Space Shuttle mission schedules, which are published in Excel, directly to your Outlook Calendar.

Due to the closure of CodePlex, this project has been relocated to SpaceShuttleTVSchedule on GitHub. To access and utilize the tool, please visit the new GitHub repository.

Please note that the NASA Space Shuttle fleet was retired in July 2011, and as a result, the project's mission schedule data is no longer updated. However, you can still use it to view historical data and reminders of past missions. Additionally, I encourage you to explore the retired shuttles on display at their respective retirement homes:

- Discovery at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum-Udvar-Hazy
- Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex
- Endeavour at the California Science Center

On July 21, 2011, 5:57 AM EDT, landing announcer: *"Having fired the imagination of a generation, a ship like no
other, it's place in history secured, the space shuttle pulls into port one final time. It's voyage at an end."*

Atlantis Commander Chris "Fergie" Ferguson: *"Mission complete, Houston. After serving the world for over 30
years, the space shuttle has earned its place in history. It's come to a final stop."*

Houston CAPCOM, astronaut Barry "Butch" Wilmore: *"We copy your wheels stopped, and we'll take this
opportunity to congratulate you, Atlantis, as well as the thousands of passionate individuals across this great,
space-faring nation who truly empower this incredible spacecraft, which for three decades has inspired millions
around the globe, Job well done."*

Atlantis Commander: Chris "Fergie" Ferguson: *"Hey thanks, Butch, great words, great words. You know, the space
shuttle has changed the way we view the world and it's changed the way we view our universe. There are a lot of
emotions today, but one thing is indisputable -- America's not going to stop exploring. Thank you Columbia,
Challenger, Discovery, Endeavour and our ship, Atlantis. 
Thank you for protecting us and bringing this program to such a fitting end. God bless all of you, God bless the United States of America."*

This text provides an overview of the final missions of Atlantis and Endeavour in the Space Shuttle program. It includes mission schedules, notable highlights, and information about the NASA Space Shuttle TV Schedule Transfer to Outlook Calendar program.

Editorial Opinion:
The retirement of the Space Shuttle program brought mixed emotions. While the capabilities of the Shuttle to transport cargo to low Earth orbit and return goods were unmatched, cost and safety concerns led to its retirement. The experience of witnessing Shuttle launches and landings remains unparalleled, and many space enthusiasts look back fondly on the era. The author expresses joy at having witnessed the last launch of Apollo and anticipates comparing it to the Space Shuttle experiences.
